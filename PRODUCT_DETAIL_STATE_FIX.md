# Product Detail State Issue - Fix Summary

## 🐛 **Problem Identified:**

When navigating between different product detail pages, the customization state (variants, add-ons, quantity, special instructions) was persisting from the previous product. This happened because:

1. **Singleton Cubit**: The `ProductDetailCubit` was registered as a singleton in the dependency injection container
2. **State Persistence**: The cubit instance was reused across different product detail pages
3. **No State Reset**: The cubit wasn't clearing previous selections when loading a new product

### **User Experience Issue:**
- User customizes "Veggie Wrap" → adds to cart
- User clicks "Customize" on "Iced Coffee"
- Product detail page shows "Iced Coffee" but with "Veggie Wrap" customizations selected
- User cannot change customizations (state appears "stuck")

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### **1. Create New Cubit Instance Per Page**
**Before (Problematic):**
```dart
// Reused singleton cubit instance
BlocProvider(
  create: (context) => context.read<ProductDetailCubit>()..loadProduct(productId),
  child: const ProductDetailView(),
)
```

**After (Fixed):**
```dart
// Fresh cubit instance for each product detail page
BlocProvider(
  create: (context) => ProductDetailCubit(
    context.read<ProductRepository>(),
  )..loadProduct(productId),
  child: const ProductDetailView(),
)
```

### **2. Key Changes Made:**

#### **ProductDetailPage (`product_detail_page.dart`)**
- **Removed**: Dependency on singleton `ProductDetailCubit`
- **Added**: Direct instantiation of `ProductDetailCubit` with `ProductRepository`
- **Added**: Import for `ProductRepository`
- **Result**: Each product detail page gets a fresh cubit instance

#### **ProductDetailCubit (`product_detail_cubit.dart`)**
- **Kept**: Original `loadProduct` method (no need for state reset)
- **Reason**: Since we create a new instance, it starts with clean initial state

## 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

### **Fresh State Per Product:**
1. User clicks "Customize" on Product A
2. **New `ProductDetailCubit` instance created** for Product A
3. User makes customizations and adds to cart
4. User clicks "Customize" on Product B
5. **New `ProductDetailCubit` instance created** for Product B
6. Product B starts with clean state (no customizations from Product A)

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ **Clean State**: Each product detail page starts fresh
- ✅ **No State Bleeding**: Customizations don't carry over between products
- ✅ **Proper Isolation**: Each product has its own cubit instance
- ✅ **Memory Efficient**: Old cubit instances are garbage collected when page is disposed

## 🔧 **Technical Details:**

### **Dependency Injection:**
- **ProductDetailCubit**: Still registered with `@injectable` for potential reuse elsewhere
- **ProductDetailPage**: Creates new instances as needed
- **ProductRepository**: Injected via `context.read<ProductRepository>()`

### **State Management:**
- **Initial State**: `ProductDetailState.initial()`
- **Loading State**: `ProductDetailState.loading()`
- **Loaded State**: `ProductDetailState.loaded()` with clean default values
- **Error State**: `ProductDetailState.error()`

### **Memory Management:**
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Flutter's `BlocProvider` automatically disposes cubit when page is disposed
- **No Memory Leaks**: Each cubit instance is properly cleaned up
- **Efficient**: Only creates new instances when needed

## 🚀 **Expected Behavior Now:**

### **Scenario 1: Same Product, Multiple Times**
1. Customize "Veggie Wrap" → add to cart
2. Click "Customize" on "Veggie Wrap" again
3. **Result**: Fresh customization state (no previous selections)

### **Scenario 2: Different Products**
1. Customize "Veggie Wrap" → add to cart
2. Click "Customize" on "Iced Coffee"
3. **Result**: Clean state for "Iced Coffee" (no "Veggie Wrap" customizations)

### **Scenario 3: Navigation Flow**
1. Browse products → Click "Customize"
2. Make selections → Add to cart → Return to catalog
3. Click "Customize" on different product
4. **Result**: Fresh customization experience

## ✅ **Testing Checklist:**

- [ ] Navigate to Product A detail page
- [ ] Make customizations (variants, add-ons, quantity, special instructions)
- [ ] Add to cart
- [ ] Navigate to Product B detail page
- [ ] Verify Product B shows clean state (no Product A customizations)
- [ ] Make different customizations for Product B
- [ ] Verify customizations work correctly
- [ ] Add Product B to cart
- [ ] Verify cart shows both products with correct customizations

The fix ensures each product detail page has its own isolated state management, providing a clean and predictable user experience! 🎉
