# Cart Item Merge Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem
When adding different items to the cart, they were being merged as the same item instead of being treated as separate items.

**Example:**
- Add "Veggie Wrap" ($9.99)
- Add "Iced Coffee" ($4.99)
- **Result**: Cart shows only "Veggie Wrap" with quantity 2 and total $19.98

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `matchesProduct` method in `CartItemModel`:

```dart
// BUGGY CODE:
bool matchesProduct(String productId, List<String> variants, List<String> addons) {
  return productId == productId &&  // ⚠️ BUG: Comparing parameter with itself!
      _listEquals(selectedVariants, variants) &&
      _listEquals(selectedAddons, addons);
}
```

**Problem**: `productId == productId` always returns `true` because it's comparing the parameter with itself, not with the cart item's product ID.

## Fix Applied
Changed the comparison to properly check against the cart item's product ID:

```dart
// FIXED CODE:
bool matchesProduct(String productId, List<String> variants, List<String> addons) {
  return this.productId == productId &&  // ✅ FIXED: Compare with cart item's product ID
      _listEquals(selectedVariants, variants) &&
      _listEquals(selectedAddons, addons);
}
```

## How It Works
The `matchesProduct` method is used by `CartModel.addItem()` to determine if a new item should be:
1. **Merged** with an existing item (same product + same variants + same add-ons)
2. **Added as new item** (different product or different variants/add-ons)

### Before Fix:
- Any item being added would match any existing item (due to `productId == productId` always being true)
- Result: All items were merged into the first item

### After Fix:
- Items are only matched if they have the same product ID AND same variants AND same add-ons
- Result: Different products are treated as separate cart items

## Expected Behavior Now
✅ **Different Products**: Added as separate items
- Veggie Wrap ($9.99) → Cart Item 1
- Iced Coffee ($4.99) → Cart Item 2

✅ **Same Product, Different Variants**: Added as separate items
- Veggie Wrap (Small) → Cart Item 1
- Veggie Wrap (Large) → Cart Item 2

✅ **Same Product, Same Variants**: Merged into one item
- Veggie Wrap (Small) + Veggie Wrap (Small) → Single item with quantity 2

## Testing
The cart should now correctly:
1. Show separate items for different products
2. Show separate items for same product with different variants/add-ons
3. Merge items only when they are truly identical (same product + same variants + same add-ons)
4. Calculate totals correctly for each separate item
